Summary
-------

I have a broad academic background in mathematics and computational sciences. I also have a broad industry background in areas including financial services, information retrieval, and entertainment/social platforms. I focus on machine learning and large-scale data mining problems.

I also believe in giving back to society through teaching and software solutions to social justice issues.
